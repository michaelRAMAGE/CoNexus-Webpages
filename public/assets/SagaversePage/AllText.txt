Sagaverse Gaming (Intro)

Sagaverse Gaming consists of custom games and events that seamlessly integrate with the Dischordian Saga's lore and enhance the NFTs’ narrative.

These experiences, created by ourselves, as well as in collaboration with our Web3 partners, provide extra rewards, encourage community interaction, and expand engagement across diverse games, metaverses, and blockchain platforms.


B4N

Battle For Nexon is a simple space invasion mini-game that evolved from the Inception Ark holder’s decision to throw caution to the wind and recklessly descend upon the planet Nexon in pursuit of an AI Warlord. In the process, this move alerted the General’s AI fleet of their presence.

Can you navigate the storm of enemy warships and end the ruthless reign of the AI overlords?


AA

Ark Assassin is a simple archery mini-game based on the lore of when the Potentials decided to enter the temple’s chambers and lead a direct assault on Binath’s flagship. 

Can you navigate the temple and destroy the AI Security forces to reach the inner chambers and eliminate your target?


PW

Project Warhawk is the code name for our upcoming multiplayer top-down shooter game based on the clans formed by Potentials classes.


The Dark Zoo

The Dark Zoo is a map in the Great Escape game by GLMR Apes, based on the lore where the Gibbon got captured in a high-tech zoo guarded by the Keepeer and under the control of the vicious AI overlord, the Collector.

Can you escape and combat the robotic jailers while seeking out Knowledge Crystals to uncover the dark motives of the Collector and guide Generous Gibbon to freedom?
